  - contentLeft: "Once a gnome of the Limbo, Murmur \u2014 whose tongue defied the
      very boundaries of silence \u2014 at last provoked the ire of a demigod. As
      punishment, he was granted immortality, and within his mouth was sown a living
      galaxy: a spiraling abyss of stars and void that devoured forever the sound
      of his voice. "

    contentRight: Now eternally mute, Murmur drifts through endless torment, a vessel
      of cosmic agony condemned to suffer beyond the reach of time itself.
