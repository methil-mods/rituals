  - contentLeft: "Before the first dawn, Regium ruled in silence.\nHis crown was
      not metal but form \u2014 a rectangle for the world\u2019s base, and three
      triangles rising from it, left to right, marking law, balance, and light.\nThrough
      these shapes he held the horizon together, waiting for the Saviour who never
      came.\nCenturies turned to stillness. In the quiet, geometry grew heavy, and
      the light that once crowned him began to fade."

    contentRight: "When hope broke, Regium raised his crown to the stars, demanding
      an answer.\nThe sky gave him only reflection. His crown split \u2014 first
      the left triangle, then the middle, then the right \u2014 each fall tearing
      through creation like a blade of symmetry.\nHe pressed the rectangular base
      against the cracks to save his realm, but the foundation folded inward.\nKing
      and kingdom sank together into the endless hollow \u2014 the Limbus."

  - contentLeft: "In the Limbus, Regium\u2019s form repeats forever: a rectangle
      beneath three triangles, a crown both whole and broken.\nThose who trace it
      may hear him stir \u2014 the left spike his fall, the middle his grief, the
      right his hunger to return.\nDrawn together, they recall the Crown of Four
      Shapes, the last order before descent.\nTo remember it is to invite his gaze.
      To complete it is to wear his curse."
