  bookContent:
  - contentLeft: "In the forgotten interstice between waking thought and dream\u2019s
      decay, there is whispered the name of Pudor \u2014 a name not uttered, but
      recoiled from, as one shrinks from the shadow of a memory half-remembered.\n\nIt
      is said that Pudor walks not among men, nor within the spheres of the known
      cosmos, but drifts in the thin hollows between sight and silence. His presence
      is heralded not by sound or form, but by a gesture \u2014 the hand forever
      raised to his face. No mortal, nor god, nor the thing that dreams behind both,
      has ever seen what lies beyond that shrouding palm."
