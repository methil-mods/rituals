  - contentLeft: 'Flosculus was once a priest in a 14th-century almshouse. Gradually
      delving into the occult arts, he spiraled into madness while gradually losing
      his human form and mutating into something half-monster, half-humanoid.


      Flosculus
      eventually grew horns on his head and then donned a mask to hide the monstrosity
      he had become.'
