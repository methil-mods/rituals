## ͼ Stuck in the Game ͽ  

**⚠️ Spoiler Warning ⚠️**

### Game Mechanics  

In *Rituals*, your goal is to discover which ritual to draw in order to summon an entity.  
You can access the ritual space in the bottom-left corner of the map.  
There, you’ll find a blank canvas to draw on. You can clear, finish, or quit the ritual at any time.  

- *Clear:* Erases your current drawing.  
- *Finish:* Uses our custom CNN to predict which entity your drawing represents, summoning it if a match exists.  
- *Quit:* Exits the ritual table without erasing your drawing.  

The game is structured around a room-based system. Once a room is unlocked, you can always return to it.  
To unlock new rooms, you must solve various enigmas. Currently, there are two types:  

- *Ritual:* Find which ritual to draw.  
- *Passkey:* Discover a code using clues hidden in books and from summoned entities.  

Interactive spots are marked with a red ritual symbol on the ground.  
When standing over one, press **E** to interact — you may open a book, access the ritual table, or trigger other effects.  
Be careful: some books are trapped and can send you into the **Limbus**. You’ve been warned.
